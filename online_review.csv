The tray above vegetable bin does not have any plastic border. It is just a glass with sharp borders. Can cause serious cuts if not handled properly. Rear side foot stands are quite small. Once should definitely buy a fridge stand to protect from any floor spillover. There is no coolpack although referred in product kit. No defrost tray. The water will spill out on defrosting.,3

I was worried about my TV experience in low budget and I cannot afford LG, SONY and SAMSUNG high end TVs. Low Budget segments from these makes are not upto the mark as per my research. So competition was between either Mi or Vu. Don't compare this TV with QLEDs and OLEDs. They are high quality brand Tvs which require deep pockets too. I, Like many other thought Vu is Chi...",4

Tv display is bit flimsy while holding the tv for mounting, but it may be because it is large at 55 Inch.5.
